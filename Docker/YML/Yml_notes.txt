rememeber you must have a space followed by colon differentiatin the key and the value, eg: <fruit: apple>
in Yml Dictinory/Map you must have equal number of blank spaces before the properties of a single item, so they are all aligned together. eg:
Banana:
	color: yellow
	price: 1
Grapes:
  color: green
  price: 2

watch video spaces-in-YML.mkv 

any line beggining with a dash is automatically ignored and considered as a comment.
