Linear regression erros assumptions:
	1- normaly distributed
	2- mean of zero
	3- all errors have same variance (they are homoscedastic)
	4- unrelated to each orhter (they are independent across observations) (we could not predict sign of next error given previous error sign(amir))

residuals = resid(lm_model)
