Linear regression erros assumptions:
	1- normaly distributed
	2- mean of zero
	3- all errors have same variance (they are homoscedastic)
	4- unrelated to each orhter (they are independent across observations) (we could not predict sign of next error given previous error sign(amir))

residuals = resid(lm_model)

When we look at a set of plots here on the residuals, we'll be able to assess normality.
