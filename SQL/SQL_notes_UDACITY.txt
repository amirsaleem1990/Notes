SQL vs. NoSQL

You may have heard of NoSQL, which stands for not only SQL. Databases using NoSQL allow for you to write code that interacts with the data a bit differently than what we will do in this course. These NoSQL environments tend to be particularly popular for web based data, but less popular for data that lives in spreadsheets the way we have been analyzing data up to this point. One of the most popular NoSQL languages is called MongoDB
--------------------------------------------------
There are many different types of SQL databases designed for different purposes. In this course we will use Postgres within the classroom, which is a popular open-source database with a very complete library of analytical functions

SQL isn't Case Sensitive

Semicolons

Depending on your SQL environment, your query may need a semicolon at the end to execute. Other environments are more flexible in terms of this being a "requirement." It is considered best practices to put a semicolon at the end of each statement, which also allows you to run multiple commands at once if your environment is able to show multiple results at once.
