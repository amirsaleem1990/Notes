CNN (convolution neural networks) for vision
RNN (recurrent 	 neural networks) and LSTM(Long short-term memory) for sequance data (temporal or NLP)

RELU:
	rectified linear unit
	rectified: if the prediction from linear function is nagative then the prediction is chaneged to 0, so using RELU we get all predictions >= 0

audo is represented one dimontional time series

text, audio, and images are unstructred data. 

much harder for computers to make scence of unstructred data compared to structered data.
