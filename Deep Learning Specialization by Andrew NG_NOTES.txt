CNN (convolution neural networks) for vision
RNN (recurrent 	 neural networks) and LSTM(Long short-term memory) for sequance data (temporal or NLP)

RELU:
	rectified linear unit
	rectified: if the prediction from linear function is nagative then the prediction is chaneged to 0, so using RELU we get all predictions >= 0

audo is represented one dimontional time series

text, audio, and images are unstructred data. 

much harder for computers to make scence of unstructred data compared to structered data.
  

agar data kafi zyada na ho to ML use karty hen, jahan par koi improvement lany k lye zaroori h k feature enginearing aap khud karen. or agar aap k pas data bohot zyada h to aap us ko DL model me fit kar sakty hen, jahan aap ko feature enginearing ki zaroorat nahi h.
