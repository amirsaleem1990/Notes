Ubuntu: they release two distributions every year, so they release a version in October, and they release a version in April. So for this year, for example, 2017 they'll come out with 17.04 and 17.10. So in the even number of years, they release long term support distributions, meaning that, whatever they develop for that operating system and integrate the packages that work with it, will be supported for many years. So the off... the odd years or the off schedule ones. So like 16.04 for example was a long term support or LTS version of Ubuntu. 

Packages are used to package software for linux, like an installer
Some package formats:
    Ubuntu – deb/dpkg
    Red Hat – RPM and YUM
    Solaris – pkgadd


What is a package management system?
    Set of tools/utilities to make it easier to install, upgrade, remove and configure software packages.
    Typically connect to the internet and download packages from remote servers

Why are some better than others?
    Package managers that do not recursively get dependencies are more difficult to use.


Ubuntu uses APT (Advanced Packaging Tool)
    Synaptic and aptitude are Front End interfaces
    Synaptic has GUI
    aptitude has text based GUI

APT uses /etc/apt/sources.list to list which servers to download the packages from
    Can add more servers and more packages
    Can setup your own repositories (repos) for package distribution - this is a must in high security environments

Red Hat uses YUM
YUM uses /etc/yum.repos.d/ to list which servers to download the packages from
    Can add more servers and more packages
    Can setup your own repositories (repos) for package distribution - this is a must in high security environments


2 primary distributions:
    CentOS - It's the binary equivalent of Red Hat and runs great for servers in the enterprise
    Ubuntu - Runs great as a desktop. There are many flavors of Ubuntu however depending on what GUI you want.

In order to see if things are working correctly, we're going to ping resources. So I'll type in ping and then a name. I should receive a response back which means that both my route is working and my DNS is working. If my DNS is not working, I can try just pinging the gateway and see if I get a response. If I don't get a response from the gateway, then I know there is something wrong with my system. 


defaul ssh port 22 hoti h, agar hame is port ko change karna h to </etc/ssh/sshd_config> ko open karen, wahan par 1 line commented ho gi <Port 22>, is ko uncomment kar den, or <22> ko ksi bhi number sy replace kar den (let say, is ko 2237 sy change kar den), phir Terminal par ye commmand run karen: semanage port -a -t ss_port_t -p tcp 2237; systemctl restart sshd.service; now open the port in firewall: firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=2237/tcp

Gnome-schedule is a GUI for cron

interact with the sudo file, grant sudo privileges to certain users, and allow them to execute privileged commands with or without a password. Sudo is a program that allows users to run programs, on behalf of another user, typically, the super user or root. And it can be configured by the sudo file that specifies how sudo access is granted for a given user. In order to view or modify the sudoers file, you must have super user or root privileges. 
>> su root
The sudoers file is located at /etc/sudoers. The sudoers file should not be edited with a normal file editor, so we're going to use visudo. 
>> visudo
This line right here <root ALL = (ALL)>  means that any user with the username of root has access to execute all commands If the root password is entered. Obviously the root user should have these privileges already. 

Each line should have the following elements. First, the user the line applies to here. Is called the root. 
Next, the host, which the line can be applied to. In this case, all. This is useful if you're copying the file from system to system. 
Next, the =All specifies. The users which the person running the sudo command must be in this case ALL users. 
And finally the commands which the specified user can run in this case, ALL commands. 

Let's add a user here. So I'm going to press i for insert, because I'm in VI. Then I type in greg_test. I'm going to hit the Tab button, not the Space button. Tabs must be used here instead of spaces in order for the file to work correctly. So I'm going to execute the same commands. ALL=ALL in parenthesis. Tab ALL. Okay. So let's write :wq (to quit).



now let's modify greg_test2 in order to run fdisk without a password.  Type in /etc/sudoers greg_test2 ALL=NOPASSWD Tab remember the ALL, this third string here is for commands, type in sbin/fdisk. (greg_test2  ALL=NOPASSWD   ALL     /sbin/fdisk)


su user_name  .................. swith to user_name user.

create user ................. sudo adduser user_name .......... this will create not only the user but its /home directory and permitions.

chance/create anohter user's password ............. sudo passwd 

#...............................................
#/etc/passwd
>> sudo cat /etc/passwd
...
amir:x:1000:1000:amir:/home/amir:/bin/bash
...
so here <amir> is a user name.
<x> means this user has a password
<1000> user id
</home/amir> home directory
</bin/bash> shell the user have.

in this file we also find lines that ends with <nologin> eg: 
proxy:x:13:13:proxy:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin 
This (nologin) means that we're going to use an account which is basically a service account that allows us just to use the service and execute commands, but it doesn't allow the user that we create to login anywhere. If we want to lock a user out, this is the quickest way to lock somebody out of their account. This would be in `the cases, if we wanted to, if somebody was leaving the organization 
#...............................................

in the /etc/default/useradd we can specify muliptle atributes of user, such as SHELL, HOME, INACTIVE, EXPIRE, CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL and more.

...............................................Securing users ...............................................
if we need to chane home directory for user:
mkdir new_folder
sudo chown user:user new_folder
sudo vipw ........... change here 
<user:x:1000:1000:user:/home/user:/bin/bash> to 
<user:x:1000:1000:user:/home/new_folder:/bin/bash>



# removing users. This is a common occurrence with organizations. If somebody leaves, we not only have to remove the file, but we also need to search for anything that the user may have left behind. When we delete a user, we're gonna type in the command <userdel>. userdel remove user from /etc/passwd file. 

when we have a user that has left the company, we also need to make sure of a couple other things. We need to remove their access for many local databases, remove any alias files that they have, remove any cron jobs. We need to remove the user's home directory or their mail queue and any other files that they may have had on the system. So let's check to see if we have any other files out there. Let's type in ll /home. You'll notice that not only is greg_test3 still here, but now it has no user or group associated with it. However, it still has the security ID, so we need to remove that directory.


Let's also make sure that we don't have any lingering files for the user. In order to do this, <sudo find / -xdev -nouser>. What this does is it looks for any files out there without any user associated with it.  if any file appear delete it.


# change file/folder permitions 
The way file permissions work inside of Linux is in powers of 2. So the read is worth 4, the write is worth 2, and the execute is worth 1, totaling 7 bits. So if I wanted to change all seven bits, for read, write, execute, for the entire file, I would type in sudo chmod 777 file_name.



With acl, we can add permissions to other groups or users that typically do not have access to certain files. 
for example we need to give user_1 purmission for my/file.txt, so: setfacl -m u:user_1:rwx my/file.txt, now ls -l my/file.txt return as follows: -rw-r--r--+ , so there is extra <+> in the last, and this is tell as that this file has extra purmitions.

if we create empty /etc/nologin no anyone else mine  can login into same user. .......... sudo touch /etc/login ; ssh 127.0.0.1 (try to login to localhost), but you'll get an error, if we remove this file now you can login to localhost.

ksi bhi user k 1 waqt me kitny login ho sakty is ko limit kar k lye /etc/security/limits.conf file ko open karen, or wahan par ye line add kar den ......... user_name        -       maxlogins       number_you_want(eg: 4)

Firewall: 
Firewalls are extremely important to understanding where our attacks come from and limiting those attacks. We can also log information that comes in from these attacks

There are several software-based firewalls within Linux. two of them:
    1- UFW (for ubuntu) (UFW stands for Uncomplicated Firewall)
    2- firewalld (new firewall within CentOS and Red Hat-type systems)

So let's start out with UFW.
Now where we came from was what we called IPFilter. IPFilter is a packet-filtering software that can be configured for a variety of different platforms. So we also then had iptables which introduced a stateful firewall ruleset into Linux systems. However, IPFilter is still around and is still being manipulated. It's still a loadable kernel module and can be implemented statically within the kernel. However, there have been problems with trying to configure IPFilter and iptables. They're very complicated to understand. They have many intricacies that it makes difficult for a normal user to try to configure. So, the later firewall versions, UFW and firewalld, allow us to really easily configure firewalls within our Linux systems. In UFW (Ubuntu) is enabled and disabled by default on Ubuntu systems, but it also has packages for Debian systems and Arch. It is still a way that we can manage iptables, just with more ease. 
UFW commands:
ufw status ....... return status of firewall
ufw show raw .......... rules that it already has created. Notice this is a huge amount. This is what UFW creates when we easily type in and allow or deny port or IP address, and it just keeps on going on and on.
ufw allow 53/udp ......... (53 is DNS and udp is protocol).
Let's say that we also want to allow SSH, ufw allow ssh.
And let's say that we also want to allow communications from a different system. So let's say <ufw allow from 192.168.18.131
to any port 22>.
We can also do the exact same thing for denying rules. However, instead of where we say allow, we're going to say deny. So if we wanted to deny port 80, for example, ufw deny 80. 

Now let's say that we want to look at these firewall rules again. We're gonna type in ufw status numbered. This shows us the status of our firewall and any rules that we have set up. If we look at the firewall rules, the raw firewall rules again for iptables, it's gonna shows us a lot more rules than what we currently had. Let's say that we want to look at what we just created – ufw status numbered. Very simply, we have this information. However, let's look to see what changed in the background for iptables. So ufw show raw, and we're gonna grep for port 22. Quite a few more commands, and that's in a lot of different chains, what we call change inside of iptables. So, UFW allows us to not only add services and ports, but it looks at IP addresses as well. Now, UFW still manages iptables.
This is not the case in the new firewalld for Red Hat-type systems.
So let's switch over there,
and let's look at firewalld.
If we type in firewall -cmd state,
we'll see that it's running,
just like we did on UFW.
We also have the concept of zones which is similar to chains inside iptables.
In order to look at the zones,
we can type in firewall -cmd --get -zones.
These are our standard zones.
The only one that is actually populated, however, is public.
If we want to look at services,
we can look at firewall -command --get -services.
There are many different type services,
and let's actually list this out here.
So it looks like there's 54 words overall – 1 line,
54 words, 471 characters.
Now let's say that I wanted to add a service.
In order to add a service,
I'm just gonna type in firewall -command --zone=public.
And let's say on this server,
I wanted to add a web server --add -service=http.
Success.
Now within Red Hat-type systems,
I can still enable iptables if I want to,
if I wanted to get really,
really granular with trying to put a firewall into my system.
However, with the new firewalld,
there is no need;
and with firewalld, we're less prone to make mistakes.
Firewalls within Linux should always be
used to stop services and decrease our attack surface.
